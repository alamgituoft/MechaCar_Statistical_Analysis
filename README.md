The results show:

1) The two variables **vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance** are likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the MPG values in the data set. 

2) The p-Value for this model is **5.35e-11** which is less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. As a result, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis which concludes that the slope of the linear model is not zero.

3) The R-squared value is 0.7149 which can be interpreted that approximately 71% mpg of MechaCar prototypes predictions is correct using this model.
