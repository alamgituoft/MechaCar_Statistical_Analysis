The results show:

1) The two variables **vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance** are likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the MPG values in the data set. 

2) The p-Value for this model is **5.35e-11** which is less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. As a result, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis which concludes that the slope of the linear model is not zero.

3) The R-squared value is 0.7149 which can be interpreted that approximately 71% mpg of MechaCar prototypes predictions is correct using this model. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils 
### Summary Results
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
Below the variance of suspension coils of all three lots combined was **62.29** which is within the design specifications.

When reviewing the Lots individually both variances for Lot 1 & 2 are within the design specifications. However the variance in Lot 3 is very high and exeeds the manufacturers specifications **(170.28)**.
